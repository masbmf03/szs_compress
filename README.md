# SZS Compress

SZS Compress scans a directory for every .szs file and then utilises Wiimms SZS tool in order to extract and then compress the SZS files, resulting in a smaller file size.

This allows for faster loading/downloading times alongside easier file management.

## Usage

- Open szs_compress.py with Python or launch CMD and type `python (filepath)`.
- Paste the filepath to your directory containing your SZS files.
- Press enter and allow for the compression to occur.
- The SZS files in your directory will be replaced with the compressed SZS files.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.X or later
- Windows 7 or later
